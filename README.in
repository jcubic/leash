* Enabled CGI with python or perl on the server

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:: Shell Limitations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* you will not be able to execute interactive commands like `php -a`
* you can't create a function and run it in next command (because each
  command is run as separated process)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    configurable from config.json
  * sudo option, if set, will allow to execute commands are real unix user
    to create new user you will need to use linux command line (adduser command
    from real terminal) and you will need to have leash user with the same name,
    (to add user from leash you need to be root and execute adduser command)
    and have sudo access without password for apache user

* to have full use of leash you will also need one of functions enabled:
  * exec
  * system
  * shell_exec
  * or cgi (perl or python in cgi-bin directory)
* if you want to have mysql or sqlite commands you need to install those databases
  and appropriate php modules

  by package expect - actually it's expect script), it will make not interactive
  shell act like real terminal (tty)
